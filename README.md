## UX

### Design Thinking

I thought of creating a website with easy accesibl content regarding mental health.So I created a website with following components

- Navigation bar with logo and links to different parts of the page.
- Need help button for those who need urgent help, it opens a modal with a form.
- Dropdown list for different categories of mental health problems.

### Colour Scheme

- `#640D5F`: a dark purple color used for navbar,footer and headings.
- `#D91656`: a dark-pink color used for text in modal.
- `#EB5B00`: Orange color used as secondary color for custom buttons and social links when hovered.
- `#FFB200`: Light yellow color used as highlight-color-light to highlight social links .
- `rgb(6, 91, 6)`: Green color for need help button

I used [colorhunt.co](https://colorhunt.co/palette/640d5fd91656eb5b00ffb200) to generate my colour palette:

### Typography

- I used [Inter](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Inter) for the main body text of the website. 
- I used [Macondo](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Macondo) for titles and headings.

- I used [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com) icons for the footer, allowing me to present links to social media platforms in a succinct manner.

## User Stories

- As a user I want to access articles research about mental health topics,
so that I can better understand mental health conditions, symptoms, and treatment options.
- As a visitor to the website,I want to view a dedicated page that highlights selected mental health issues,so that I can easily access information about specific conditions and understand their symptoms, causes, and treatments.
- As a person experiencing a mental health crisis,I want to find a list of emergency helplines and crisis intervention contacts, so that I can get immediate help if I need it.

- As a First-Time Visitor, I need easy navigation and a user-friendly design, including a responsive layout for my device, so I can find information quickly and efficiently without frustration.

## Wireframes

 I kept my wireframes simple and used them as the foundation from which to build my final product. I wanted users to see a grid format of challenges when the page first loaded:
- Four challenges per row on Desktop
- Two challenges per row on tablet
- One challenge per row on mobile

This manner of approach would ensure that users would receive precisely the information they came to the site for.

I used [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/wireframes) to design my site wireframes.
