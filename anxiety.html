                addiction
                (which may include mentions of alcohol or drug use), which some people may find triggering.</p>

            <h2>What is anxiety?</h2>
            <p>It’s normal to feel anxious sometimes. It’s how we respond to feeling threatened, under pressure or
                stressed: for example, if we have an exam, job interview or doctor’s appointment.

                Anxiety isn’t necessarily a bad thing. It can spur us on, help us stay alert, make us aware of risks and
                motivate us to solve problems.

                However, anxiety can be a problem if it affects your ability to live your life. If your anxiety is
                ongoing, intense, hard to control or out of proportion to your situation, it can be a sign of a mental
                health problem.

                Help is available no matter how long you’ve felt anxious or severe your symptoms. There are many
                different types of treatment, so talk to your GP about all your options. For more information, visit the <a href="https://www.nhs.uk/nhs-services/services-near-you/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">NHS services near you</a> page.

            </p>

            <h2>What are the symptoms of anxiety?</h2>
            <p>Anxiety can affect both your body and mind.

                The effect on your mind can include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>a feeling of dread or fearing the worst</li>
                <li>feeling on edge or panicky</li>
                <li>difficulty concentrating</li>
                <li>irritability</li>
                <li>feeling detached from yourself or the world around you</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Physical feelings can include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>restlessness</li>
                <li>feeling dizzy or light-headed</li>
                <li>wobbly legs or pins and needles in your hands and feet</li>
                <li>shortness of breath or hyperventilating</li>
                <li>heart palpitations (a noticeably strong, fast heartbeat)</li>
                <li>nausea (feeling sick)</li>
                <li>needing the toilet more or less often</li>
                <li>sweating</li>
                <li>sleep problems</li>
                <li>panic attacks</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Anxiety can also affect your behaviour. You may withdraw from friends and family, feel unable to go to
                work, or avoid certain places. While avoiding situations can give you short-term relief, the anxiety
                often returns the next time you’re in the situation. Avoiding it only reinforces the feeling of danger
                and never gives you a chance to find out whether your fears are true or not.</p>

            <p>Some people with anxiety may appear to be fine on the outside while still having some of the symptoms
                listed above. You may have developed ways of hiding your anxiety so that other people don’t notice it.
            </p>

            <h2>What is an anxiety disorder?</h2>
            <p>If your anxiety symptoms meet certain criteria, your GP may diagnose you with an anxiety disorder. Some
                common anxiety disorders include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>generalised anxiety disorder – feeling anxious or worried most of the time</li>
                <li>panic disorder – having regular panic attacks, often for no apparent reason</li>
                <li>post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) – having anxiety problems after experiencing a very stressful
                    or frightening event</li>
                <li>social anxiety disorder – a fear or dread of social situations</li>
                <li>obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) – having recurring unpleasant thoughts (obsessions) and
                    performing certain routines (compulsions) to relieve anxiety</li>
                <li>phobias – an overwhelming fear of a specific object, place, situation or feeling</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Anxiety disorders are among the most common mental health problems. Up to 1 in 20 people in the UK have a
                generalised anxiety disorder.</p>

            <h2>What causes anxiety disorders?</h2>
            <p>Many different factors can make anxiety disorders more likely to happen. These include genetics, painful
                long-term health conditions, traumatic events such as childhood abuse or domestic violence, or drug or
                alcohol misuse. Your current life situation can also trigger anxiety – for example, money or housing
                problems, unemployment, work stress, loneliness, bullying, or difficult family or personal
                relationships.</p>

            <h2>Getting support</h2>
            <p>There are different ways to treat and manage anxiety disorders. The right treatment for you will depend
                on your type of anxiety disorder, how severe it is and your circumstances.</p>

            <p>The first step to getting support is usually to speak to your GP. This might feel hard, especially if
                your anxiety makes it difficult to speak on the phone or leave your home. See if you can book an
                appointment online or ask someone to call up to book it for you. They could also come with you to your
                appointment for support. Or you could refer yourself for talking therapy (in England only) if that feels
                easier.</p>

            <p>Your GP will assess you during your appointment and then explain your treatment options.</p>

            <h2>Self-help resources</h2>
            <p>Your GP may offer you self-help resources such as workbooks or online CBT courses. These are often
                available quite quickly and may be enough to help you feel better without trying other options. NHS
                Inform has an online anxiety self-help guide you can work through.</p>

            <h2>Talking therapy</h2>
            <p>This involves working through your thoughts, feelings and behaviours with a mental health professional.
                Two kinds of therapy are particularly recommended for anxiety.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) can help you learn strategies for recognising and overcoming
                    distressing or anxious thoughts.</li>
                <li>Applied relaxation involves learning to relax your muscles in situations that usually make you
                    anxious.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Medication</h2>
            <p>Different medications manage both the physical and psychological symptoms of anxiety. Talk to your GP
                about which one might be right for you.</p>

             <a href="https://www.nhs.uk/mental-health/conditions/generalised-anxiety-disorder-gad/#medication" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The NHS website has more information about medication for anxiety disorders. You can find it</a>

            <h2>Ways you can look after yourself</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Talk about how you’re feeling and what's making you anxious. Just being heard and understood may
                    make you feel better. You could open up to a friend or call Anxiety UK’s helpline.</li>
                <li>Look after your physical health. Eating well, staying physically active, avoiding cigarettes and
                    alcohol and getting enough sleep can also help you manage anxiety better.</li>
                <li>Breathing exercises can help: our page on panic attacks has some suggestions. Some people find
                    practising mindfulness useful, but be aware it isn't recommended for social anxiety.</li>
                <li>Consider joining a peer support group. They offer a safe place to share your experiences and worries
                    with other people who also have an anxiety disorder. Ask your GP about local groups or visit our
                    page on peer support. <a href="https://www.anxietyuk.org.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">online support groups</a></li>
            </ul>
